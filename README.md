# Newdoku

Simple Sudoku solver written in Rust. Method is inspired by a method briefly outlined in a CS lecture I had that I decided to try and implement based only on my understanding from the lecture.

It is called Newdoku because I started doing this a while ago and forgot about it and decided to restart, hence "New"

# Quick Start

```console
$ cargo run
```
